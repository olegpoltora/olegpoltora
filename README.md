# Throughput issues?

*Do you have any efficiency problems with high-load system? I will help you to maximize performance and throughput.*

I have experience in increasing stability and throughput of systems. I dealt with load balancing, fault tolerance, ensuring minimal downtime and I was involved as independent expert for appraisal of software services quality.

## Nuances of Java development

*This blog is about Java development and describes in detail the most interesting topics*

### All you want to know about Singleton

The singleton design pattern is one of the most inappropriately used patterns. In this article we review several implementations of a singleton that work correctly in multithreaded environment, with serialization and cloning tasks and even with reflection attacks. [more detailsâ€¦](https://poltora.info/blog/all-you-want-to-know-about-singleton/)

### SynchronousQueue VS TransferQueue

One addition in Java 7 is an interface TransferQueue in addition already exists from Java 5 SynchronousQueue. What is the reason of new interface? [more detailsâ€¦](https://poltora.info/blog/synchronousqueue-vs-transferqueue/)

### How to use ConcurrentHashMap in Java

Before Java 1.5, if you need Map implementation, which can be safely used in multithreading Java-application, you have only Hashtable or synchronized Map, because HashMap is NOT safe. [more detailsâ€¦](https://poltora.info/blog/how-to-use-concurrenthashmap-in-java/)
